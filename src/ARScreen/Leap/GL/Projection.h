// Projection provides procedures to compute an orthographic projection matrix
// or a perspective projection matrix.
//
// Notes on Orthographic projection
//
// - SetOrthographic provides a means to compute the projection matrix for
//   an arbitrary, axially-aligned orthographic view box (not necessarily symmetric
//   about the x and y axes).
// - SetOrthographic_UsingSymmetricViewBox provides a means to compute the
//   projection matrix for a symmetric axially-aligned orthographic view box (symmetric in
//   the sense that the view box is symmetric in each of x and y).
//
// Before understanding what the orthographic projection is, it's important to note
// that the "view" coordinates are a right-handed coordinate system that have the
// positive x axis extending to the viewer's right, the positive y axis extending
// upward along the view, and the positive z axis extending toward the viewer.
//
// The symmetric orthographic view box is the axially-aligned, oriented box
//   [-w/2,w/2] x [-h/2,h/2] x [-n,-f]
// where w := width, h := height, n := near clipping plane depth, and f := far clipping
// plane depth.  Note that f-n must be positive, and therefore -f < -n, so the oriented
// interval [-n,-f] is reversed on the number line.  The orthographic projection operation
// maps the oriented orthographic view box onto the oriented box
//   [-1,1] x [-1,1] x [-1,1]
// noting that -n in the 3rd coordinate maps to -1 and -f maps to 1.  The x and y coordinates
// in the projection will be used to determine the x and y coordinates on screen, while the
// z coordinate in the projection gives value that will be used in the depth buffer (lower
// depths are closer to the viewer).
//
// The asymmetric orthographic view box is similar to the symmetric case, except that it
// isn't necessarily symmetric in each of the x and y coordinates).  It's the axially-aligned,
// oriented box
//   [l,r] x [b,t] x [-n,-f]
// where l := left, r := right, b := bottom, t := top, and n and f are as before.
//
// Note that the projection operation is defined as follows.  The 3-vector U = (x,y,z) is
// "homogenized" to produce a 4-vector V = (x,y,z,1).  The projection matrix P is multiplied
// onto W (as a column vector) to produce a projected 4-vector W = P*V.  In order to get
// a 3-vector from the 4-vector W, it is re-projected into the hyperplane whose 4th coordinate
// is 1 -- this is done by dividing the whole vector through by its 4th coordinate.  For
// example,
//   (a,b,c,d) |-> (a/d, b/d, c/d, 1).
// The first three coordinates are taken as the projected 3-vector (in the example, the
// projected vector is (a/d, b/d, c/d)).  In the case of the orthographic projection, the
// 4th coordinate of the 4-vector V will always be 1, so the division step doesn't change
// anything.
